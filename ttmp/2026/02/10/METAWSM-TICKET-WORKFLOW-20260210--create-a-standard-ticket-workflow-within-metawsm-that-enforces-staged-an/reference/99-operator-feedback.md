# Operator Feedback

## 2026-02-10T07:06:49-08:00

Required workflow: Step 1 use docmgr to create codebase relevance analysis and ask for feedback; if relevant areas are unclear, ask first. Step 2 create implementation plan, request feedback, and iterate until approval. Step 3 break approved plan into tasks, then implement while maintaining diary updates and incremental commits. Step 4 open PR and iterate on review feedback until done.
